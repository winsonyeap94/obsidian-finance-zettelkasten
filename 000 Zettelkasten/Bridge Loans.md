## Bridge Loans

A bridge loan is a **short-term loan** used until a person or company *secures permanent financing* or *pays an existing obligation*.
- It allows the borrower to meet current obligations by providing immediate cash flow.

Bridge loans are also called **"gap loans"** or **"swing loans"**, and are typically made when a more permanent financing source or some specific event is expected to pay it off within a year.

Bridge loans have relatively high interest rates and are usually backed by some form of collateral, such as real estate or the inventory of a business.

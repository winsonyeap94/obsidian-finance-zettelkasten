## Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR)

The fixed-charge coverage ratio (FCCR) measures a firm's ability to cover its **fixed charges** (e.g., debt payments, interest expenses, and equipment lease expenses). 
- It shows how well a company's earnings can cover its fixed expenses.

A higher FCCR result indicates that a company can adequately cover fixed charges based on its current earnings alone.

$$
\text{FCCR}= \frac{\text{EBIT} + \text{FCBT}}{\text{FCBT} + i}
$$
where:
- $\text{EBIT} = \text{earnings before interest and taxes}$
- $\text{FCBT} = \text{fixed charges before tax}$
- $i = \text{interest}$

FCCR is *broader than [[Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)]]* because it includes other fixed obligations such as lease payments.

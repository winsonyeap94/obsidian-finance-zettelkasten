## Risk Mitigation

There are three primary tools commercial bankers use to mitigate risks:
1. Collateral
2. Loan covenants
3. Guarantees

>[!warning] It is worth remembering that **only cash repays loans**.
>As helpful as collateral, loan covenants, and guarantees are, none of them can repay a loan.

### (1) Collateral

Collaterals are **assets which are pledged as security** for a loan.
- If a borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup its losses.

An example is when we borrow money to buy a car or a home. We have pledged those assets as collateral for those loans.
- We don't own the asset "free an clear" (of liens) until we pay off the loan and receive the title and deed in the mail stamped "Paid in Full".

Note that collaterals are not as simple as it first appears. Consider the following characteristics of our collateral:
1. **Location**
	1. Do we know where it is?
	2. Is it all in one place or scattered in various known or unknown places?
	3. How much would it cost us to find it, collect it, and sell it?
2. **Liquidity**
	1. How quickly and simply could we convert it to cash?
	2. Is it "self-liquidating" (e.g., inventory) or not (e.g., real estate)?
	3. How much would we actually get for it if sold at auction?
3. **Marketability**
	1. Would the bank be able to sell it if the borrower couldn't?
	2. Is the bank legally allowed to liquidate it (e.g., alcohol, firearms)?
4. **Public Relations**
	1. Would the bank sustain reputational damage by liquidating it?
	2. Would the bank foreclose on a church or a university?

### (2) Loan Covenants

The word **covenant** simply means *an agreement between two parties*.

In commercial banking, a loan covenant refers to a written agreement between the bank and the borrower in which the borrower *promises to do (affirmative) or not do (negative)* certain things.
- These covenants can also be *financial* or *non-financial*.

| Loan Covenant Type        | Example                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Affirmative Financial     | Borrower must maintain minimum net worth of $1,000,000.  |
| Affirmative Non-Financial | Borrower must provide financial statements quarterly.    |
| Negative Financial        | Borrower's debt service coverage must not be < 1.25 : 1. |
| Negative Non-Financial    | Borrower cannot change ownership without bank consent.   |
Loan covenants are meant to act as guardrails. If they swerve beyond these boundaries, they are said to have **"tripped"** or **"breached"** the covenant.
- This is serious business because the borrower has broken its promise *even if it has continued to make its required loan payments*.
- Failure to comply with a loan covenant is considered an event of default. This means that the bank can call the loan, forcing the borrower to pay the full balance immediately.
- In practice, banks rarely do this, but it does allow them to **renegotiate the pricing on the loan** or **charge a [[waiver fee]]** for the covenant default.

### (3) Guarantees

A guaranteed loan is a loan that a **third party guarantees -- or assumes the debt obligation for** -- in the event that the borrower defaults.
- Where collateral is a secondary source of repayment, guarantees are a *tertiary source*.

A parent company can also provide a guarantee to its subsidiary, these are called **"corporate guarantees"** compared to personal guarantees.

Sometimes, the guarantee is not the full amount of the loan, but for a limited dollar amount or percentage of the outstanding balance only. These **"limited guarantees"** serve as a compromise when banks want a full (unlimited) guarantee but the borrower is unwilling to take that much risk.
- Loans made with no guarantees of any kind are called **"non-recourse"**.

## Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

The debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) measures a firm's **available cash flow to pay its current debt obligations**.
- The DSCR shows investors and lenders whether a company has enough income to pay its debts.

$$
\text{DSCR} = \frac{\text{Net Operating Income}}{\text{Total Debt Service}}
$$
where:
- $\text{Net Operating Income} = \text{Revenue} - \text{COE}$
- $\text{COE} = \text{Certain Operating Expenses}$
- $\text{Total Debt Service} = \text{Current Debt Obligations}$

Income taxes complicate DSCR calculations because *interest payments are tax deductible* and principal repayments are not. A more accurate way to calculate total debt service would be:
$$
\text{TDS} = (\text{Interest} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})) + \text{Principal}
$$

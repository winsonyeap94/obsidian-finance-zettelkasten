## Role and Framework of Capital Market Expectations (CMEs)
### Role of CMEs

1. CMEs are **key inputs** in deciding strategic asset allocation.
2. They allow portfolio managers to build **efficient portfolios**.
3. Useful in formulating risk and return expectations for **broad asset classes**.
4. Align the **risk-return objectives** with investor expectations.
5. Can be used to identify **short-term mispricing.**

### The 7-Step Framework for Formulating CMEs

| No  | Step                                      | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Specify expectations needed               | Requires creating an explicit, written list of the **asset classes** and **investment time horizons** involved.                                |
| 2   | Examine historical records                | Analysts must **study and analyse previous asset class characteristics** and attempt to understand what drives them.                           |
| 3   | Specify methods and models                | The most appropriate methods must be **predetermined and used throughout the framework** in order to ensure consistency.                       |
| 4   | Determine the best sources of information | - Established sources are the best.<br>- Analysts are expected to stay abreast of **emerging sources** and to fully understand the data used.  |
| 5   | Interpret current environment             | Analysts must deliver a common set of assumptions with consistent methodologies and judgments based on experience.                             |
| 6   | Deliver documented expectations           | The expectations should be supported by reasoning as well as assumptions in a documented form.                                                 |
| 7   | Monitor actual outcomes                   | - As the expectation turn into outcomes, they should be recorded, monitored, and studied.<br>- This can **improve and hone future forecasts**. |

## Challenges in Developing Capital Market Forecasts
### Limitations of using economic data

1. **Lag** between the *collection* and the *distribution* of the data.
2. **Varying definitions** of data in different countries.
3. **Rebasing** can change the way the indices are calculated.
	- e.g., changes in what is included when calculating CPI.
4. Changes in **index composition**.

### Data measurement errors and biases

1. **Transcription errors**
	- Incorrect recording of data.
2. **Survivorship bias**
	- Low-performing managers, funds, or securities are removed from a dataset after becoming defunct.
	- *Inflates returns of the index*.
3. **Use of appraisal data (smoothed data)**
	- Data or assets which are *infrequently valued*.
	- Missing data points when creating a time-series analysis underestimates standard deviation.

### Limitations of historical estimates

1. **Regime changes** due to changes in economic, political, regulatory, and technological reasons
	- May lead to *non-stationary data*.
2. It is recommended to use data over a **long period of time**.
	- Adequate data may be unavailable.
	- Use of *high-frequency data* to get a long series may result in *asynchronous data*.
	- The more the data, the more possible regime changes.
3. Using **ex-post risk and return**
	- Using historical data to justify future metrics assumes that the past always repeats itself, i.e., a *false assumption*.
4. **Non-repeating data patterns**
	- False relationships may appear to be driving capital market expectations.
	- Analysts must understand what is driving the movements in order to *spot spurious relationships*.
5. Failing to account for **conditioning**
	- Need to account for the *current economic conditions* in the models.
6. **Misinterpretation of correlations**
	- Mislabelling the independent and the dependent variables.
		- e.g., it is incorrect to think the amount of corn grown would influence the amount of rainfall.

> [!info] Non-stationary data has varying statistical properties across periods in a time series.
> This can be problematic when carrying out standard statistical tests.

### Psychological Traps

This includes both emotional and cognition biases:
1. **Cognitive biases**
	1. Examples - Conservatism, Confirmation, Control, Hindsight, Information processing, Framing, Anchoring, Mental accounting, Availability, Representativeness
2. **Emotional biases**
	1. Examples - Loss aversion, Endowment, Self-control, Status quo, Overconfidence, Regret aversion

### Model or Input Uncertainty

1. **Model uncertainty**: The appropriate forecasting model to use - Is the model structurally and/or conceptually correct?
2. **Parameter uncertainty**: Estimation errors in model parameters.
3. **Input uncertainty**: Are the inputs correct?

## Exogenous Shocks

Exogenous shocks refer to **external factors which have a profound effect** on the growth of an economy.
- They may lead to *statistical regime changes*.

### Sources of Exogenous Shocks

| Source                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Policy changes                      | Policies with a positive impact on growth:<br>- Sound fiscal policy<br>- Minimal intrusion on the private sector<br>- Competition within the private sector<br>- Sound tax policy<br>- Erecting trade barriers has a negative impact on growth |
| New products and technology         | Pro-growth factors:<br>- Technological advances<br>- Innovations<br>- New products                                                                                                                                                             |
| Geopolitics                         | Pro-growth factors - Geopolitical tensions may:<br>- Lead to development of new technology<br>- Encourage innovation<br><br>Growth inhibiting factors:<br>- Trade barriers<br>- Using resources to acquire weapons<br>- Defense spending       |
| Natural disasters                   | - *Demolition of old capital* which is replaced by more technologically advanced assets may *enhance growth*.<br>- Always tend to be *growth-inhibiting*.                                                                                      |
| Natural resources / Critical inputs | - *Natural resource discovery* and extraction promote growth.<br>- *Depletion of resources* diminishes growth.                                                                                                                                 |
| Financial crises                    | - Occur when the *public loses faith* in intermediaries' ability to funnel capital to its highest and best use.<br>- Can cause a run on banks or a stock market crash, both growth-inhibiting scenarios.                                       |
## Application of Economic Growth Trend Analysis to the Formulation of CMEs

Expected trend growth rate is an *input* in developing CMEs.

Key considerations of economic trend growth rate:
1. Higher trend growth rates imply **higher yields on government bonds**.
2. **Discounted cashflow models** incorporate the trend growth rate when forecasting returns.
3. Higher trend growth rates may imply **higher stock returns**.
4. Higher trend growth rate may result in a **faster growing economy** given that *increase in inflation is sustainable*.

There is a difference in economic trend growth rate between developed & emerging economies:

| Developed Economies                                                                                                                         | Emerging Economies                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Trend growth rate is relatively **stable**.<br>- Reasonable to extrapolate past rates as initial estimates for future trend growth rates. | - Trend growth rate is **less predictable**.<br>- Adjustments need to be made to past rates when estimating future trends. |
### Growth Decomposition

**GDP** can be thought of a combination of two components:
1. Growth from **labour**
2. Growth from **labour productivity**

![[Pasted image 20240715212247.png]]

### Asset Returns and Trend Growth Rate of GDP

- Trend growth rate is useful in estimating:
	- **Bond yields** over the long run.
		- Real default-free bond yields are *mean-reverting.
		- They *move toward real GDP trend growth rate in the long run.
	- **Equity appreciation** over the long run.
		- The trend growth rate acts as an *anchor for long-run equity appreciation*.

$$
\text{Aggregate Market Value of Equity} : V = GDP \times S^k \times PE
$$

- GDP = Available profits being allocated to businesses and private citizens.
- $S^k = \frac{\text{Earnings}}{\text{GDP}}$ = Share of profits in the economy.
	- This is the amount of GDP which goes to *firms*, not private citizens.

- $S^k$ and $PE$ influence markets in the **short run**.
	- But, they *cannot persistently* increase or decrease in the long run.
- GDP is the **main driver** of aggregate stock market valuation over the long run.
$$V \rightarrow GDP$$
>[!warning] High economic growth rate does not guarantee high equity market yields as:
>1. Growth rate may already be *factored into equity prices* in anticipation of future economic growth.
>   2. If the rate of capital growth *exceeds* the rate of economic growth, the return on capital may decrease, and so equity returns may be expected to decline.


## Major Approaches to Economic Forecasting

### (1) Econometric Modelling
--- start-multi-column: ID_l8tb
```column-settings
Number of Columns: 3
Largest Column: standard
```

Description:
- The application of *statistical methods* to map out relationships among economic variables.
- Models may range from simple to very large and complex systems with hundreds of formulas.
- Economic variables used include: Interest rates, commodities, prices, exchange rates, etc.
- *Structural models* are based on *economic theory*.
- *Reduced form models* may be models driven by data, with a heuristic criteria for selecting variables and the functional form.

--- column-break ---

Strengths:
1. Models can be *robust*, incorporating many factors to estimate reality.
2. *Data* may be collected and consistently used within models to quickly generate output.
3. Models deliver *quantitative estimates* of the impact of changes in *exogenous variables*.
4. The modelling process imposes discipline and *consistency* in analysis.

--- column-break ---

Weaknesses:
1. Models can be *complex* and time consuming to formulate.
2. Data may not be easy to forecast.
3. Relationships may not be static among variables.
4. Models may be mis-specified.
5. A *false sense of precision* may arise.
6. Econometric modelling rarely forecasts *turning points* well.

--- end-multi-column
### (2) Economic Indicators

- Economic statistics **released by official agencies** and/or private organisations.
- Contain information on an economy's *recent activity* or its *current or future position* in the business cycle.
--- start-multi-column: ID_xtb4
```column-settings
Number of Columns: 3
Largest Column: standard
```

Examples:
1. **Lagging indicators**
2. **Coincident indicators** - Move with changes in the business cycle.
3. **Leading indicators** - e.g., the yield curve, weekly jobless claims, etc.
4. A **diffusion index** - Measures multiple indicators at a time. May be used to gain a broader perspective on the timing of the business cycle.

--- column-break ---

Strengths:
1. Generally *intuitive* and *simple* to construct.
2. Focus primarily on identifying *turning points*.
3. May be available from third parties, which makes them easy to track.

--- column-break ---

Weaknesses:
1. Subject to frequent revision.
2. Can provide *false signals*.
3. May result in inconsistent results.

--- end-multi-column
### (3) Checklists
--- start-multi-column: ID_sezo
```column-settings
Number of Columns: 3
Largest Column: standard
```

Descriptions:
- Forecasters may consider a wide range of economic data to gauge the economy.
- Checklists can be made up to include whatever important variables the forecasters deem worthy.
- It is a more *subjective approach*.

--- column-break ---

Strengths:
1. Less complex.
2. Flexible.
	- Structural changes are easily incorporated.
	- Items can be added or dropped easily.
	- Can draw on any information from any source as preferred.
3. Can include any topics, perspectives, theories, and assumptions.

--- column-break ---

Weaknesses:
1. Subjective and arbitrary.
2. Judgmental.
3. Time consuming.
4. Manual process constraining the depth of analysis.
5. Lack of a clear mechanism for combining disparate information.
6. Imposes no consistency of analysis across items or different points in time.
7. May allow the use of biased and/or inconsistent views, theories, or assumptions.

## Business Cycles and Short/Long-Term Expectations

![[Pasted image 20240715214724.png]]

The **business cycle** refers to variation of economic productivity (often measured in terms of GDP) around its long-term trend state.
- It is this **long-term trend state** that serves as an **anchor** for forecasting business environments.
	- The economy cannot grow any faster than its long-term trend rate sustainably.
	- The long-term trend rate is always *mean-reverting*.
- Movements around the trend rate are ultimately **stochastic**.
	- So, business cycle phases vary in terms of *intensity* and *length*.

The **output gap** is the difference between the *actual output* of an economy and the *maximum potential output* of an economy, expressed as a % of GDP.
$$
\text{Output Gap} = \text{Actual Output} - \text{Maximum Potential Output}
$$

### The Business Cycle and Market Expectations

- The formulation of CMEs seem straightforward under the previous descriptions.
- If this is true, then it should be easy to make a few forecasts and earn abnormal returns.
- The truth is that it is quite a bit *more complex* than that.
- Evidence has shown that the business cycle exhibits the **highest predictive power** over the span of **1 to 3 years**.

## Implications of Inflation

### Inflation and the Business Cycle
--- start-multi-column: ID_jbt3
```column-settings
Number of Columns: 2
Largest Column: left
```

Three types of "Inflation":

1. Inflation - Rising Prices
	- It is **procyclical**.
	- **Accelerates late** in the business cycle when there is *no output gap*.
	- It falls during recessions and the early recovery stage when the output gap is large.
2. Disinflation
	- A **deceleration in the rate of inflation**.
	- Happens when the economy is *moving into a recession*.
3. Deflation - Falling Prices
	- Negative inflation.
	- It **reduces** the value of **debt-financed investments**.
	- **Inhibits** the central bank from stimulating the economy using monetary policy as interest rates are close to 0.

### Inflation and Asset Classes


--- start-multi-column: ID_8o2a
```column-settings
Number of Columns: 4
Largest Column: standard
```

Cash
- It is a floating rate instrument with zero duration.
- Earns the **real rate of interest** when inflation is within expectations.
	- A greater than expected inflation -> *higher* cash yields.
	- A lower than expected inflation -> *lower* cash yields.
- **Deflation has a positive impact on cash** if nominal interest rates are bound by 0%.
 
--- column-break ---

Bonds (Nominal Fixed-Rate Bonds)
- Bond prices and interest rates have an **inverse relationship**.
- **Short-term bond yields are more volatile** than long-term yields when inflation is within expectations.
	- Higher/lower than expected inflation -> *More volatile longer-term bond yields* relative to shorter-term bond yields.
- **Deflation is favourable for fixed-income bonds** as the *future cashflows will have a higher purchasing power*, ignoring the risk of default.

--- column-break ---

Stocks / Equities
- **Equities tend to outperform** their fixed-income counterparts in periods of *rising interest rates*.
	- Higher than expected inflation can be a *headwind* for equity.
- Some firms can **pass on the higher costs to consumers**.
- Future earnings and dividends of a company are expected to rise and fall in line with inflation expectation.
- **Deflation has a negative impact on equities** due to the decline in economic activity.

--- column-break ---

Real Estate
- Real estate is **unlikely to adjust** in line with inflation expectations in the *short-intermediate term*.
- Real estate value **increases in line with inflation in the long-term**.
- **Deflation negatively affects** real estate as property values decline.

--- end-multi-column
## Monetary and Fiscal Policy on Business Cycles

### Monetary Policy

![[Pasted image 20240715224843.png|700]]

- A tool used by central banks to intervene in the business cycle.
- Monetary policy is **counter-cyclical**.
- Central banks use monetary policy to prevent the economy from either *overheating* or suffering from a *recession* for too long.
- The aim is to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maintain growth around its long-run sustainable rate</mark>.
	- Growth exceeding the long-run rate -> Leads to **increased inflation**.
- **Restrictive monetary policies** are employed towards the end of an expansion.
	- However, overtightening may lead to a recession.
- The central bank reduces short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy.

**Reducing short-term interest rates** will lead to:
1. *Increased spending* by consumers and businesses.
2. *Increased prices* of equities and bonds.
3. *Lowers the value of domestic currency*, which increases exports.

#### Taylor Rule

A guide for central banks in **setting appropriate policy rates**.
$$
i^* = r_{\text{neutral}} + \pi_e + 0.5\big[y_e - y_{\text{trend}}\big] + 0.5\big[\pi_e - \pi_{\text{target}}\big]
$$
- $i^*$ : Target nominal short-term interest rate
- $r_{\text{neutral}}$ : Neutral real short-term interest rate
- $y_e$ : Expected GDP growth rate
- $y_{\text{trend}}$ : Long-term trend in the GDP growth rate
- $\pi_e$ : Expected inflation rate
- $\pi_{\text{target}}$ : Target inflation rate

#### Target Rate

- Target rate refers to the rate that should be set by the central bank.
- This is equal to the **neutral rate**, scaled by the differences in expected versus trend inflation and GDP.
- This rate **balances** the risks of inflation and recession.

#### Zero or Negative Interest Rates

- Prior to 2008, it was believed that using negative interest rates to stimulate the economy would simply not work.
- Bank deposits facilitate millions of daily transactions, which would be slow, if not impossible, to achieve with pure cash.
- A negative rate is a *net payment* made to invest in *short-term instruments*.

### Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy is a tool used by the government to manage the economy. A government can implement a **loose fiscal policy** if it wants to **stimulate** the economy.
- Done by **decreasing taxes** or **increasing spending**, which increases the ***budget deficit***.

## Shape of the Yield Curve and the Business Cycle

```

- The shape of the yield curve is a reliable **leading economic indicator**.
	- It indicates the **economy's position** in the business cycle.
- The yield curve shows the relationship between interest rates and maturity of fixed-income investments.
- The curve is influenced by:
	- *Government actions*
	- *Economic conditions* (current and expected)

- The yield curve:
	- Is steep at the bottom of the cycle.
	- Flattens during the expansion.
	- Becomes flat or even inverted at the peak.
	- Re-steepens during contraction.

- A **flattening or inverted yield curve** involves *downward pressure on long-term rates* and *upward pressure on short-term rates*.

### Monetary and Fiscal Policy Mix and the Yield Curve

For monetary and fiscal policies that reinforce each other:
- For **stimulative policies**, the yield curve is *steep* and the economy is likely to grow.
- For **restrictive policies**, the yield curve is *inverted* and the economy is likely to shrink.
- A restrictive monetary policy and a stimulative fiscal policy imply a **flat yield curve**, and the effects on the economy are *unclear*.
- A stimulative monetary policy and restrictive fiscal policy imply a **moderately steep yield curve**, and the effects on the economy are *unclear*.

## Macroeconomic, Interest Rate, and Exchange Rate Linkages between Economies

### Macroeconomic Linkages

#### Current Account

A 'registry' of net exports of goods and services, net investment income flows, and unilateral transfers for a given country in a year.

#### Capital Account

An unofficial registry that accounts for net investment flows for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), less the purchase and sale of productive assets across borders, less portfolio investment flows related to financial assets transactions.

**Net exports = Net private saving + Government surplus**
National income accounting leads to the following relationship:
$$
(X - M) = (S - I) \ + (T - G)
$$
- $X$ : Exports
- $M$ : Imports
- $S$ : Savings (private citizens)
- $I$ : Investments (private citizens)
- $T$: Tax revenue
- $G$ : Governmental spending

#### Ways in which the current and capital accounts are kept in balance

1. Changes in income (GDP)
2. Relative prices
3. Interest rates and asset prices
4. Exchange rates

### Interest & Exchange Rate Linkages

- Interest rates and exchange rates are **inextricably linked**.
- There is a proposition that it is impossible for a country to simultaneously do the following:
	1. Pursue an *independent monetary policy*.
	2. Allow *unrestricted capital flows*.
	3. Maintain a *fixed exchange rate*.
- There is importance for this proposition. If the central bank pushes interest rates down:
	1. Capital will flow out.
	2. Putting downward pressure on the exchange rate.
	3. Forcing the bank to buy its own currency.
	4. Thus, reversing the **expansionary policy**.

- Given a **perfect capital mobility** and a **fixed exchange rate**:
	- Countries whose currencies are *pegged* to each other should have the *same interest rate*.

- When the currencies are **not pegged**, the link between interest rate differentials and currency movements show the following factors:
	- If a currency is significantly *overvalued and expected to decline*, bond interest rates are expected to be *higher* to compensate overseas investors for the *expected decline* in the currency value.
	- Relative *bond yields increase* with strong economic activity and increasing demand for funds.
	- Savings and investment decisions and capital productivity drive the level of real rates.

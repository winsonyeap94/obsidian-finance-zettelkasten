## Facility Type

In commercial banking, a "facility" refers to a loan, not to a building.

Businesses borrow for different reasons, and each borrowing purpose dictates a unique type of facility:
- **Lines of credit** for seasonal or short-term working capital financing.
- **Term loans** for capital expenditures, business acquisitions, or buy-outs.
- **Mortgage loans** for purchasing real estate.
- **Construction loans** to finance new building projects.
- **Bridge loans** to fill a short-term gap until a liquidity even happens.
- Time notes, term loans, or lines of credit to finance operating losses.

Facility types are not "one size fits all" although all of them involve money being lent from bank to borrower. Each facility type is like a tool in our tool belt, and we need to learn which one to reach for in any given situation.

## Decentralised Applications (DApps)

![[Pasted image 20240720202914.png|700]]

DApp is a **[[Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]]**, open source technology, organised in blocks that are linked (a.k.a. **blockchains**) and identifiable through **cryptographic verification**.

DApps run on distributed networks.
- In a distributed network, there is *no single location or entity that "owns" the data*; the **block** houses the data.
- A node adds transactions to a ledger. Those transactions are *visible to all the nodes* on the network, but once added, they can never be removed.

**Consensus protocol** determines the creation of blocks, which are validated by each node.
- Each node is in a decentralised data network and is synchronised with the other nodes in that network.
- All nodes must agree on the data before it is added to a block in the blockchain.

### Comparing DApps to traditional applications

Advantages:
1. Decentralised data structure (DDS) makes information *available in "now" time* and *keeps a chronological record* of all activity held as an *immutable* instance.
2. *Cheaper* to run than traditional applications or face-to-face processes.
	- For example, payment and remittance processes as well as clearance houses and regular online banking queries are recorded in fractions of seconds, and the transaction costs are minimal.
3. More *secure*.
	- A distributed ledge is impenetrable to attack. It's also unchangeable.
4. Assures *transparency* of records and automated enforcement of rules.
5. Data integrity is immutable.

Disadvantages:
1. *Poor scalability* due to the complexity of the DDS configuration.
2. Steep learning curve for both users and developers.

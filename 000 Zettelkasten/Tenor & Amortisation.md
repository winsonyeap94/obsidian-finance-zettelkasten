## Tenor & Amortisation

**Tenor** refers to how *long it takes a loan to mature*, or come due for full payment.
**Amortisation** tells us over *what period of time the principal amount of the loan will be paid back*.

In some cases, the tenor & amortisation period are the same.
- e.g., company buys an equipment with expected useful life of 5 years. In the 60th month of the loan, the final monthly payment would be made, and the loan would be paid off concurrent with its maturity.

In other cases (e.g., real estate mortgage loan), the **tenor would be shorter than the amortisation period**.
- e.g., for a building, a 25-year amortisation would be more appropriate and would result in a much lower monthly payment for the borrower. However, the tenor might still be only 5 years. 
	- This means that the loan would mature after only 5 years with a [[balloon payment]] (the remaining principal balance) being due at that time.

## Origination Fees

If the bank agrees to lend the money to the business, the loan agreement will typically include a **one-time feed to be paid to the bank up front** -- that is, at the time the loan is closed.
- This is called a **"commitment" (origination) fee** and is *usually no more than 1% (100bps)* of the total loan amount.

Sometimes referred to as **"discount fees"** or **"points"**, particularly when they equal 1% of the amount borrowed.

Origination fees pay for services such as *processing, underwriting, and funding*.

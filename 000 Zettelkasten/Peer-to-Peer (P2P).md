## Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

![[Pasted image 20240720203128.png|800]]

### Context of Economic Services

A peer-to-peer (P2P) service is a decentralized platform whereby two individuals interact directly with each other, without **intermediation by a third party**. Instead, the buyer and the seller transact directly with each other via the P2P service. The P2P platform may provide services such as search, screening, rating, payment processing, or escrow.

### Context of [[Decentralised Applications (DApps)]]

Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is **no central store of data**; each computer can act as a server for the others in use, and all have shared access.

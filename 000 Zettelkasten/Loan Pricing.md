## Loan Pricing

Theoretically, loan pricing is based on **risk** -- the greater the risk, the higher the *interest rate spread* should be.
- This "risk/reward" concept, however, is true only up to a point. Some borrowers simply pose too much risk, and no interest rate spread can adequately compensate the bank for it.

### Documents Involved

1. [[Promissory Note]]
	- This note includes the legal names of the bank and the borrower, the amount of the loan, how it is to be repaid, and the interest rate.
	- It is signed by both parties, and in some cases, this simple document is all that is required to close a commercial loan.
2. [[Loan Agreement]]
	- In most instances, however, the transaction is *more complex*.
	- The agreement details additional *structural elements (risk mitigants)* of the loan.

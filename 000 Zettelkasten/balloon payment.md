## balloon payment

Balloon payment is a **large, one-time amount due at the *end of the loan***. 
- As the term "balloon" suggests, the final payment on this type of loan is significantly large.
- The borrower pays much smaller monthly payments until the balloon payment is due. These payments may be entirely or almost entirely interest on the loan rather than principal.
